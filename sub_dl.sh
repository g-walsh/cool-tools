# A simple bash script to download subtitle files for any files in a directory
# that currently don't have subtitle files (named exactly the same). This
# script requires the cli version of the excellent tool Filebot
# (filebot.net) which is written in java. Please support their excellent work
# by donating/buying Filebot.
