# Tools and Scripts
### A collection of small scripts/tools that I've written

A list of scripts that I've added here with brief descriptions

- **sub_dl** - A script to auto download any missing subtitles from a video library.
- **audioconvert** - A script to convert an audio library from any codec to any desired codec.
- **ovpngen.sh** - A script to autogenerate full .ovpn files from my OpenVPN set up.
